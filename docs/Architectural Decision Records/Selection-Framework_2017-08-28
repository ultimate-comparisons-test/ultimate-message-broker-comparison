# Choose selection framework

## Context

During the implementation of `Clicking on a tag should search for it` (issue #27) we noticed that we could not get the value of the
tag into the elements in the GUI.
We needed a framework that allowed to add values to the elements via code.

## Status 2017-08-28

### Proposed frameworks

- angular2-select
- ng2-select
- ng2-select-custom

### Deprecated

`angular2-select` because it was not easily possible to select items programmatically.

### Accepted

`ng2-select` because it allows adding selected items programmatically.

### Rejected

`ng2-select-custom` because it is a fork of `ng2-select` and offers only marginal advantages that do not justify to switch to a fork.
